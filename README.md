<h3>Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification</h3>

<h5>This project implements a binary chest X-ray classifier (Pneumonia caused due to Covid19 vs Normal) using transfer learning with a pretrained CNN.
The emphasis is on training stability, reproducibility, and principled design choices, not just metric maximization.</h5>
 
<h4>Approach<h4>
<ul>
<li>Model: DenseNet-based CNN pretrained on ImageNet</li>
<li>Framework:Tensorflow / Keras</li>
<li>Task : Binary Image Classification</li>
<li>Strategy: Frozen Training -> Fine-Tuning</li>
</ul>

<h4>Project Structure</h4>

- `src/` – data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation code  
- `notebooks/` – exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- `requirements.txt` – project dependencies  
- `.gitignore` – ignored files and directories

<h4>Key Design Decisions</h4>
<h5>No Data Resampling</h5>
<h6>Class imbalance was not addressed via over/undersampling to preserve real sample diversity and avoid overfitting from duplicated images.
Instead, robustness is improved through augmentation and regularization.</h6>

<h5>Learning Rate Scheduling</h5>
<h6>ReduceLROnPlateau is used to automatically lower the learning rate when validation loss saturates, leading to more stable convergence during fine-tuning.</h6>

<h5>Label Smoothing</h5>
<h6>Label smoothing is applied to reduce overconfident predictions and improve generalization, which is particularly important in medical imaging tasks with potential label noise.</h6>

<h4>Training Strategies</h4>
<ol>
<li>Frozen training of the classification head<li>
<li>Fine-Tuning of the upper convolutional layers with a reduced learning rate<li>
</ol>
<h5>This balances stability and domain adaptation.</h5>

<h4>Results</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Test Accuracy: 82.34%<b><li>
